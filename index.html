    <h1>My Biography</h1>
    <p>I have been a career student in the sense that I enjoy taking classes and learning new things.  I currently hold a master's in Information and Communication technology with a focus on web design, a bachelors of science degree in Technology Management, an associate degree in Transportation, Web Design, and Information Technology.  However, my ultimate goal would be to acquire a job that makes me happy.  I think I will forever educate myself but not always through the traditional means of brick and mortar schools.</p>
