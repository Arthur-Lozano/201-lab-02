    <h1>My Biography</h1>
    <p>
      I have been a career student in the sense that I enjoy taking classes and
      learning new things. I currently hold a master's in information and
      communication technology with a focus on web design, a bachelor's of
      science in technology management, an associate degree in
      transportation, web design, and information technology. However, my
      ultimate goal would be to acquire a job that makes me happy. I think I
      will forever educate myself but not always through the traditional means
      of brick and mortar schools.
